How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to quickly find the spelling error and view
    all changes without comparing all of the code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can always go back to older revisions and see where changes were made.
    It would save time if there was a problem with any of the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You may forget to create a commit. And with google docs, it may overwrite
    changes or you may have too many versions to fish through.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google is probably set for the end user. Git sounds like it is created for
    developers who need to access the versions

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    *****The log will show me versions and diff will show differences*****

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You always know you can revert to an older version that was working

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Making coding changes to a new website and testing it
